For Module 11, I was tasked to scrape data from:
https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html
and
https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html

I used Jupyter notebook to scrape the Mars news titles and preview text in the first url provided to me.

I then used Jupyter notebook to scrape the Mars weather data from the second url.
